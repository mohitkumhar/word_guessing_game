# Word Guessing Game

Welcome to the Word Guessing Game! This simple Python game challenges players to guess a randomly selected word. Players can input a letter with each turn, and the game provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is correct or incorrect. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script in your preferred environment.
    ```bash
    python word_guessing_game.py
    ```
2. Enter a single letter as your guess when prompted.
3. The game will provide feedback on whether the guessed letter is correct or incorrect.
4. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## Game Features

- **Randomly Generated Words:** The game selects a word randomly from a predefined list.
- **Visual Feedback:** The game provides visual feedback on the number of attempts remaining and displays a hangman figure as the player makes incorrect guesses.
- **Win/Lose Conditions:** The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
